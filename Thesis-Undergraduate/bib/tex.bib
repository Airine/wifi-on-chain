	abstract = {We formalize the notion of a proof of work (POW). In many cryptographic protocols, a prover seeks to convince a verifier that she possesses knowledge of a secret or that a certain mathematical relation holds true. By contrast, in a POW, a prover demonstrates to a verifier that she has performed a certain amount of computational work in a specified interval of time. POWs have served as the basis of a number of security protocols in the literature, but have hitherto lacked careful characterization. In this paper, we offer definitions treating the notion of a POW and related concepts.We also introduce the dependent idea of a bread pudding protocol. Bread pudding is a dish that originated with the purpose of reusing bread that has gone stale. In the same spirit, we define a bread pudding protocol to be a POW such that the computational effort invested in the proof may be reused by the verifier to achieve a separate, useful, and verifiably correct computation. As an example of a bread pudding protocol, we show how the MicroMint scheme of Rivest and Shamir can be broken up into a collection of POWs. These POWs can not only serve in their own right as mechanisms for security protocols, but can also be harvested in order to outsource the MicroMint minting operation to a large group of untrusted computational devices.},

	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

The challenge comes from the fact that users are autonomous and their utilities are unknown to the system designer. Under the Kelly mechanism, users bid and proportionally share resources. When user population is large and ‘‘price-taking’’ can be assumed, the Kelly mechanism maximizes the social welfare; however, under oligopolistic competitions, this mechanism might induce an efficiency loss up to 25\% of the welfare optimum.},

	abstract = {The ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless networks are on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. Despite all these advantages that 5G will bring about, there are still major challenges to be addressed, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, network privacy and security vulnerabilities. Blockchain, an emerging disruptive technology, can offer innovative solutions to effectively solve the challenges in 5G networks. Driven by the dramatically increased capacities of the 5G networks and the recent breakthroughs in the blockchain technology, blockchain-based 5G services are expected to witness a rapid development and bring substantial beneﬁts to future society. In this paper, we provide a state-of-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Software Deﬁned Networks, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main ﬁndings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identiﬁed. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.},

Understanding the relationship between communication and blockchain as well as the performance constraints posing on the counterparts can facilitate designing a dedicated blockchain-enabled IoT systems. In this paper, we establish an analytical model for the blockchain-enabled wireless IoT system. By considering spatiotemporal domain Poisson distribution, i.e., node geographical distribution in spatial domain and transaction arrival rate in time domain are both modeled as Poisson point process (PPP), we ﬁrst derive the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), blockchain transaction successful rate as well as overall throughput. Based on the system model and performance analysis, we design an algorithm to determine the optimal full function node deployment for blockchain system under the criterion of maximizing transaction throughput. Finally the security performance is analyzed in the proposed networks with three typical attacks. Solutions such as physical layer security are presented and discussed to keep the system secure under these attacks. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and optimal node deployment algorithm.},

On these blockchain-based platforms, video transcoding, which is computational intensive and time consuming, is still a major challenge. Meanwhile, the block size of the underlying blockchain has signiﬁcant impacts on the system performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based framework with adaptive block size for video streaming with mobile edge computing (MEC). First, we design an incentive mechanism to facilitate the collaborations among content creators, video transcoders and consumers. In addition, we present a block size adaptation scheme for blockchain-based video streaming. Moreover, we consider two ofﬂoading modes, i.e., ofﬂoading to the nearby MEC nodes or a group of device-to-device (D2D) users, to avoid the overload of MEC nodes. Then, we formulate the issues of resource allocation, scheduling of ofﬂoading, and adaptive block size as an optimization problem. We employ a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

It brings many advantages, but various peculiarities must be perceived, such as security, resource management, storage, and other features at the same time. This paper investigates the resource contribution model between the fog node and cloud or users when fog computing introduces blockchain. The proposed model practices the reward and punishment mechanism of the blockchain to boost the fog nodes to contribute resources actively. The behavior of the fog node in contributing resources and the completion degree of the task also for contributing resources are packaged into blocks and stored in the blockchain system to form a transparent, open, and tamper-free service evaluation index. The diﬀerential game method is employed to model and solve the above process and address the interaction between the optimal resource contribution strategy of the fog node and the optimal beneﬁt under the optimal resource contribution strategy. Indirectly, this service evaluation index also brings long-term economic beneﬁts to fog service providers. Besides, taking advantage of the performance characteristics of the collective maintenance of blockchain and the ability to establish a credible consensus mechanism in an untrusted environment, fog computing nodes, under the proposed architecture, can have speciﬁc security protection capabilities.},

Secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a ‘regulatory-instrumentalist’ nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. Thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had.
