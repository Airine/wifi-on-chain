\label{chp:conclusion}

So far, the implementation of the system is complete. 1. The proposed system runs properly and correctly, 2. It can perfectly follow the Generalized Kelly Mechanism, 3. Using PoA consensus algorithm, the transaction time is short enough for a production system.

\section{Future Plan}

\begin{itemize}
\item Try Captive Portal approach to control the bandwidth
\item Performance Evaluation
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Power consumption
      \item Response time
      \item Correctness
    \end{itemize}
\item More literature review
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More related works to compare and point out the difference and contribution
        \item Divide the related works to two parts
    \end{itemize}{}
\item Finish the thesis
\end{itemize}
